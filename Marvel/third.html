        <p>Stanley " Stan " Lee (December 28, 1922 â€  November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer and editor, actor, and film producer. Together with illustrators such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created a number of superheroes for Marvel Comics. Lee and his collaborators were the first to bring complex characters and a thoughtful shared universe to the world of superhero comics. He turned the small publishing house Marvel Comics into a large media company. From the year 2000 until his death, he was regularly represented with cameos in film adaptations of the Marvel comics.
            For his life's work, Stan Lee was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2018 in the Authors category.
